  World wide web is a collection of HTML documents. These documents are made up of something called HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is the
  basis for almost every webpage. HTML glues everything together, and the links between
  these pages are called Hyperlinks or links for short, is what makes the web, web-like.
           </p>
<p>The major pieces of the web include:
      </p>
<ul>
      <li>your computer</li>
      <li>The browser- A program runs on your computer to display files that make up the internet (ex. chrome, firefox, internet explorer).</li>
        <li>The internet- The world's largest computer network.</li>
        <li>The servers- Computers that host the file that unite the web</li>
        <li>HTTP- The main protocol of the web </li>

   <p>
     HTML documents are the heart of the web. The web is basically made up of these
     documents that can do a number of things. HTML is made up of text content
     which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks",
     references to other documents (images+videos) and links to other pages.
     This video
     gives a good overview.

  </div>
  <div>
   <p>
     HTML markup is made up of things called tags. There is an opening tag and a closing tag.
   When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each
    element by using HTML tags. A void tag is a tag that has no content, it
    does not need a closing tag.

   <div>
           <p>
    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions

   <div>
     <p>
   The browser builds a "tree like structure" of the page. Sideways triangles are HTML elements. The "tree like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... </p>
   <p> In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a standard convention for accessing and manipulating elements within HTML and XML documents. Elements in the DOM are organized into a tree-like data structure that can be traversed to navigate, locate, or modify elements and/or content within an XML/HTML document.
          </p>
<p>
            The DOM tree can be imagined as a collection of “nodes” related to each other through parent-child and sibling-sibling relationships. Each node represents an object in an XML document including elements, textual content, and comments. Each XML document contains a single root element (html in HTML, for example) from which all other nodes ultimately descend.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOM tree traversal may be accomplished through the use of six basic properties. All properties, except childNodes, contain a reference to another node object. The childNodes property contains a reference to an array of nodes.
          </p>
            <ul>

   </div>
    <div>
   <p>
   When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

   <div>
   <p>
  when writing code, programmers use special text editors (like sublime text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornestone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.
  You can read more about CSS: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">here</a> and you can find a CSS example: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">here</a>

  </div>
    <div>
      <p>
 In CSS, you first write what's called a selector and this defines what elements of the page a particular style will apply to. You can select an HTML tag and that rule will apply to all tags on the page.
 </p>
<p>Styling can be added to HTML elements in three ways:</p>
Method 1: write CSS within the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML document. To do this, at the top of your HTML document, add a &lt;head&gt; element and write the style syntax within it.
    <p>
      Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file. Both files MUST be in the same folder.
      </p>
<p>
        Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML. This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it.
        </p>
<p>
   You can find some examples of CSS styles: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp">here</a> and

<div>
  <p>
   CSS relies on pattern matching rules to determine which style applies to which element in the document. These patterns are called selectors and they range from tag names to very complicated patterns that match very specific parts of a document. A CSS selector is the part of a CSS style call that identifies what part of the web page should be styled. The selector contains one or more <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/css/a/aastylelibrary.htm">properties.</a>

      </div>
    <div>
         <p>
Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.

Avoiding Errors: When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
</p>
<p>
        <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

    <p>
  There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
      </p>
<ul>
          <li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.
          </li>
<li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.

        <li>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline),so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</li>
        <li>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</li>

     Get the structure of the page right. You should be able to do
     that from the design by visually boxifying it, then move on to
     work on the tags, i.e., if something needs to be a heading,
     make it so. Then think about the size of the boxes (how big
     should they be) and then think about positioning the boxes so
     that they are where you want them on the screen.  Once the general
     layout is complete, then begin looking at the smaller details.
          </p>
          <p>
          Steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
      <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
       <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
       <li>Write your html</li>
       <li>Apply your styles from biggest to smallest.</li>
       <li>Fix things</li>
